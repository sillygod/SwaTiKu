* SwaTiku

SwaTiku is the transliteration of a chinese word which means the collections of question to practice. In the first stage, I will solve the **Easy Collection Top Interview Questions** and use python as the mainly language to solve the problem.

For further stage, I decide to keep some notes when solving the problem in the Exercism.
